            Elizabeth Taylor once said: "His acting seemed almost effortless, it seemed almost as if he wasn't doing anything, and yet he was doing everything. It came so subtly out of his eyes, every muscle in his face - he was a film actor."  Richard Widmark once commented: "It's what every actor tries to strive for - to make it so simple, so real that anybody in the audience can say, 'Oh, I could do that' - if you can ever achieve that kind of grace in acting you're on the way.

            The UCLA Campus Events Commission and the Benny family are proud to announce the presentation of
            the presentation of the 2011 Jack Benny Award to <b>Betty White</b>.<br><br>

            The UCLA Jack Benny Award was established in 1977 by the Campus Events Commission and Mary Benny,
            the late Jack Benny's wife, in order to recognize individuals for their unique contributions to comedy.
            Since its inception, the students of UCLA - with the approval Benny Estate - have presented the
            award to some of the foremost entertainers of our time.
