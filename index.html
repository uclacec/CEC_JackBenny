            Elizabeth Taylor once said: "His acting seemed almost effortless, it seemed almost as if he wasn't doing anything, and yet he was doing everything. It came so subtly out of his eyes, every muscle in his face - he was a film actor."

            The UCLA Campus Events Commission and the Benny family are proud to announce the presentation of
            the presentation of the 2011 Jack Benny Award to <b>Betty White</b>.<br><br>

            The UCLA Jack Benny Award was established in 1977 by the Campus Events Commission and Mary Benny,
            the late Jack Benny's wife, in order to recognize individuals for their unique contributions to comedy.
            Since its inception, the students of UCLA - with the approval Benny Estate - have presented the
            award to some of the foremost entertainers of our time.

            <p>Jack Benny’s body of work has left an indelible mark on the field of comedy, delighting generations of audiences and influencing the work of countless comics and entertainers. Johnny Carson recognized him as a major influence, and Conan O’Brien recently referred to him as “easily one of the greatest comedians of his generation.” Comedy Central ranked Jack Benny number 28 on its list of “100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time,” citing his impeccable timing and ability to get a laugh by doing very little - meaning he could bring the house down with his patented pregnant pause or signature expressions. </p>
            <p>Jack Benny’s comedic sensibilities are timeless. Largely character based, his humor relied on character tropes and situations that were relatable to a wide audience, paving the way for the modern situational comedy genre. His humor was also gentle in nature; laughs were seldom made at the expense of anyone but himself, with his self-deprecating wit.</p>        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 botrightpar">
            <p>Over the course of his lengthy career, Jack Benny constantly reinvented himself, successfully responding to changes in new modes of communication and entertainment. From his modest origins performing in vaudeville, he eventually gained widespread popularity performing in radio and television, and even made forays into film. </p>
            <p>It is these qualities—his commitment to making the world a better place through laughter, his innovation and success across changing mediums, and his ability to remain true to his sensibilities despite these changes—that truly make him one of the greatest performers of the 20th century.</p>
